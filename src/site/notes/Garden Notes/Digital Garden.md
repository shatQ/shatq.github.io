# Digital Garden

- Example categories:
	-  ðŸŒ±Â _Seedling_Â for very rough and early ideas
	-  ðŸŒ¿Â _Budding_Â for work I've cleaned up and clarified
	-  ðŸŒ³Â _Evergreen_Â for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

- Zettelkasten
	- Fleeting Notes - Used for catching fresh ideas. 
	- Literature Notes - Notes created in context of a source, e.g. while reading book. It's good if they contain information like the book title, author, chapter, and page number.
	- Permanent Notes - Stand alone ideas that can be made without any direct context

- Other category system https://gwern.net/about#confidence-tags
	- topic tags
	- start and end date
	- stage tag:Â _draft_,Â _in progress_, orÂ _finished_
	- certainty tag:Â _impossible_,Â _unlikely_,Â _certain_, etc.
